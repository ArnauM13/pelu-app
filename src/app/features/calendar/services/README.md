# Calendar Services - Simplified

## Overview

The calendar services have been simplified to remove unnecessary complexity while maintaining essential functionality.

## Services Status

### ✅ **Kept - Essential Services**

#### **CalendarBusinessService**
- **Purpose**: Business logic for calendar operations
- **Features**: Business hours, lunch breaks, time slots, business days
- **Why kept**: Core business logic needed for calendar functionality

#### **CalendarCoreService**
- **Purpose**: Core calendar functionality and drag & drop operations
- **Features**: Grid configuration, appointment positioning, drag & drop state
- **Why kept**: Essential for calendar interactions and positioning

#### **CalendarStateService**
- **Purpose**: State management for calendar data
- **Features**: View date, selected day, appointments, popup state
- **Why kept**: Centralized state management for calendar components

#### **CalendarPositionService** (Simplified)
- **Purpose**: Position calculations for calendar elements
- **Features**: Time slot positioning, day positioning
- **Why simplified**: Removed Injectable decorator, now a utility class
- **Why kept**: Used by drag & drop functionality

### ❌ **Removed - Unnecessary Services**

#### **CalendarHeaderService** (DELETED)
- **Why removed**: Component simplified to use direct signals
- **Replacement**: Static literals and direct event emission in component

#### **CalendarHeaderFactoryService** (DELETED)
- **Why removed**: Component simplified to use direct data binding
- **Replacement**: Direct input/output signals in component

## Benefits of Simplification

### **Reduced Complexity**
- **Fewer dependencies**: Removed unnecessary service layers
- **Direct communication**: Components communicate directly via signals
- **Clearer architecture**: Simpler data flow

### **Better Performance**
- **Less overhead**: Fewer service injections and method calls
- **Direct state access**: No intermediate service layers
- **Faster rendering**: Simplified change detection

### **Easier Maintenance**
- **Fewer files**: Less code to maintain
- **Clear responsibilities**: Each service has a focused purpose
- **Simple testing**: Easier to test individual components

## Service Architecture

```
Calendar Components
├── CalendarHeaderComponent (simplified - no services)
├── CalendarComponent
│   ├── CalendarStateService (state management)
│   ├── CalendarCoreService (core functionality)
│   └── CalendarBusinessService (business logic)
└── CalendarPositionService (utility class)
```

## Migration Guide

### **From CalendarHeaderService to Direct Signals**
```typescript
// Before: Using service
constructor(private headerService: CalendarHeaderService) {}
this.headerService.goToToday();

// After: Direct signals
readonly today = output<void>();
onToday(): void {
  this.today.emit();
}
```

### **From CalendarHeaderFactoryService to Direct Binding**
```typescript
// Before: Using factory
const headerData = this.headerFactory.createHeaderData(...);

// After: Direct input signals
readonly mainTitle = input<string>('');
readonly viewDateInfo = input<string>('');
```

## Testing

Services are tested individually:
```bash
# Test specific services
ng test --include="**/calendar-business.service.spec.ts"
ng test --include="**/calendar-core.service.spec.ts"
ng test --include="**/calendar-state.service.spec.ts"
```

## Future Considerations

- **Monitor usage**: Track which services are actually used
- **Further simplification**: Consider if more services can be simplified
- **Performance**: Measure impact of service removal on performance
- **Maintainability**: Ensure simplified architecture remains maintainable
